# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file

    # - Labels for easier identification of Dependabot PRs
    # - Limit for the number of open pull requests
    # - Configuration for security updates
    # - Custom commit message details
    # - Ignoring certain dependencies or versions
