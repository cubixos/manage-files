# To get started with Dependabot version updates, you'll need to specify which
# package ecosystems to update and where the package manifests are located.
# Please see the documentation for all configuration options:
# https://docs.github.com/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file

version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "maven" # for Java projects using Maven
    directory: "/" # the root directory where your pom.xml is located
    schedule:
      interval: "daily" # how often to check for updates
    # Additional best practices include specifying:
    # - Assignees for the pull requests
    # - Labels for easier identification of Dependabot PRs
    # - Limit for the number of open pull requests
    # - Configuration for security updates
    # - Custom commit message details
